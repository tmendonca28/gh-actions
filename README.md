This repo is a personal learning log for mastering Git and GitHub Actions, with a focus on applying CI/CD workflows to detection engineering projects and mastering devsecops.

## Code Deployment (CI/CD)
Automate code testing, building and deployment

## Code & Repo Management
Automate code reviews, issue management etc.

## Crash Course in Git
Allows us to manage source code changes:
- Save code snapshots: **commits**
- Work with alternative code versions: **branches**
- Move btwn branches & commits: **checkout**
- Cloud Git repo storage: **push & pull**
- Move between commits: **git checkout <id>**
- Code mgmt & collaborative devpt: issues, projects, PRs
- Automation & CI/CD: GitHub Actions

### Git Workflow
- git add <file(s)> or .
- git commit
- git push

### Common git commit message formats
- feat: a new feature
- fix: a bug fix
- docs: documentation only changes
- style: formatting
- test: add missing tests
- chore: changes to the build process/auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(ci): add initial GitHub Actions workflow for CI

fix(gitignore): exclude .env files from version control

docs(readme): add learning objectives for Git and GitHub Actions

refactor(workflow): rename job steps for clarity
```

Points to note:
- Use imperative mood e.g. add
- Use present tense

### Undo commits
Use git revert \<id>
This is used to revert changes of commit by creating a new commit

### Resetting code
`git reset --hard <id>` is used to undo changes by deleting all commits since \<id>.  
We end up losing history with this

### Ignoring files with .gitignore
Allows us to specify folders and files to ignore
For example, if using MacOS and VS code, the .gitignore would look like:
```
.vscode
.DS_Store
```

### ðŸª¾Branches

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit id: "Initial Commit"
   branch develop
   checkout develop
   commit id: "Add README"
   branch feature/login
   checkout feature/login
   commit id: "Create login UI"
   checkout develop
   merge feature/login
   commit id: "Release v1.0"
   checkout main
   merge develop id: "Merge develop into main after release"
```

Creating a new branch `git branch <name>`  
We then need to change to the branch using `git checkout <name>`.  

We could also do the same faster using `git checkout -b <name>` to create and switch to the new branch instantaneously

After working on some code in the new branch, we can merge branches using `git merge <name>`



To delete a branch we use `git branch -D <name>`

### Creating a Personal Access Token
Profile â†’ Settings â†’ Developer Settings â†’ Personal access tokens

Generate new token (repo)

Copy the token and paste it into the password on VS Code.

### Collaborating with Others

To merge branches we create a **pull request**
Create a new pull request, then select base as *main* and the compare as your branch i.e. *feat-my-fancy-code*

Then click **Create Pull Request**

Provide a title and well thought out description (or follow instructions provided by the repo owner)

Then, click **Create Pull Request** again

#### Using Forks
Click Fork, then create fork

Then clone it locally using `git clone`

Set the URL by running `git remote set-url origin <URL>`

Run `git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature`

Then write out your code, stage the changes and commit them

Push your code using `git push origin feat/my-new-feature`

Go to original repo and open a PR.

Then choose the base repo as the main one and the main branch as the base, and your repo and the source and compare branch.

Add a descriptive title and message (following contribution guidelines) and Create the Pull Request


## GitHub Actions
### Building Blocks & Components
The most important parts are:
- Workflows
- Jobs
- Steps

How do these relate?
- We can have a **workflow** in a GitHub repo that has 1 or more **jobs**; each job can have 1 or more **steps**
<br></br>
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Workflow: Workflow 1] --> B[Job 1 : build]
    A --> C[Job: test]
    B --> B1[Step: Checkout code]
    B --> B2[Step: Setup env]
    B --> B3[Step: Run build script]
    C --> C1[Step: Checkout code]
    C --> C2[Step: Run unit tests]
    C --> C3[Step: Upload test report]
```
<br></br>
Workflows are triggered by *Events*.  
We define a **Runner** (execution env) within a *Job*; and contain one or more Steps to run on that runner.
They run in parallel (default) or sequential and can be conditional.   
Steps will execute a shell script or an action. These can be custom or 3P actions.   
Steps are executed in order.
